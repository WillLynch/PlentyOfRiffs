Plenty Of Riffs

Setup
-----

Make sure you have Python 3.4, and Django 1.8.4 installed. For information on installing Django,
look at the official Documentation at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/.

Another really good resource for learning to do things in Django is http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/index.html,
though it uses slightly different versions than we are, so there might be slight discrepancies. 

Personally I have chosen to use PyCharm to develop this 
project, which is an IDE that plays really nice with Django and is free for students (just search jetbrains student 
license in Google). To setup this project, I followed these 
instructions: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/quickstart/django_guide.html. 
But you can use any text editor/terminal environment you want.

To test your setup, once you have cloned the project locally,
 run 'python manage.py runserver' in the projects root directory, and then navigate to
http://127.0.0.1:8000/matchmaker in your web browser. You should see Hello World!

Try getting it working locally and let me know if you have difficulties
